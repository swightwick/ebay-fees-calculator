# eBay fees calculator

Typically, eBay charges around 10% on a standard listing. So I always wait for a promotional offer to list items on eBay. It used to be common to get £1 or £2 fees as a promotional deal from eBay, however this has recently changed to a percentage off of the original fee which isnt that straight forward to work out, thats why I created this app.
## Explaination

* `Item retail cost:` The amount you paid for the item from the shop
* `eBay item sale price:` The exact amount you sold the item for
* `Delivery cost:` Only fill in if your listing included free P&P. As the seller is taking the cost of the post it is deducted from the payout. Leave as 0 if you charged postage
* `Promotion percentage off:` Recent marketing campaigns offered 70% & 80% off. Leave as 0 to use full eBay fees.
